# Journey to Full-Stack Development

Welcome to my repository where I document my growth from a novice to a skilled full-stack developer. This repository is structured to showcase my personal journey, including comprehensive engagement through Brainster Academy and beyond.

## Repository Structure

- **Challenges**: Each branch prefixed with `brainster_challenge` contains tasks I completed weekly, demonstrating my progression in skills and understanding of web development. Each branch has a README outlining the objectives and requirements of the challenge.
- **Hackathons**: Branches such as `brainster_hackaton02_marinovDesign` highlight my ability to collaborate and apply skills under pressure, with detailed project documentation.
- **Projects**: Each project branch (e.g., `brainster_project01_brainsterLabs`) showcases applied knowledge with full project documentation.
- **Mentorships & Workshops**: (Currently being updated) These branches will soon include applications and exercises from mentorship sessions and workshops, providing deep insights and learning experiences.

## Highlights

- **Challenge Progression**: From basic HTML pages to sophisticated applications.
- **Project Complexity**: Evolving from simple websites to dynamic applications using advanced frameworks.
- **Collaborative Development**: Teamwork and strategic problem-solving during hackathons.

## Goals

This repository serves as both a portfolio and an active development space for personal and professional growth. I am currently working on adding applications from mentorships, workshops, and personal projects. Once all existing content is updated and uploaded, I will focus on developing and adding new content.
